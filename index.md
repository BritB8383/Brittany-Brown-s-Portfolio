# Brittany Brown's Data Analyst Portfolio

## Introduction

As an aspiring data analyst, I have collected my various projects to present them in this portfolio. I have followed Alex Freberg's Youtube series to accomplish many of these projects. 

### Excel Project

I used Excel to analyse a dataset from Alex Freberg's github concerning bike sales. The Excel pivot tables have been organized into a functional dashboard to view specific information. 

I have written my own formula to create better defined age brackets into periods of 10 years.

The following is my own formula:

```markdown
=IF(L5>=60;"60 +";IF(AND(L5>=50)*(L5<60);"50 - 59";IF(AND(L5>=40)*(L5<50);"40 - 49";IF(AND(L5>=30)*(L5<40);"30 - 39";IF(L5<30;"20 - 29";"Invalid")))))
```

```markdown
